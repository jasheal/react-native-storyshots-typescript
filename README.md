# React Native Component Library Starter
A starter boilerplate project for building your own component library for React Native. 

### Features
- [x] React Native & TypeScript
- [x] Storbook
- [x] Storyshots - Jest snapshots of stories
- [x] CicleCI integration
- [ ] Detox e2e UI testing
- [ ] Build component library

### Wishlist
- Auto generated documentation for Storybook and TypeScript in React Native. Currently not supported. 

### Why do I need this?
You belive that UI development should be siloed from application development to improve developer velocity in fast changing teams and projects. 

Separating UI develpment from application development allows us to be more flexible, increases code reuse and also prevents UI and business logic getting too tangled. Some other benefits include:

- Testing (Unit and e2e) of user interface components independently of business logic
- Forces developers to think of the UI like stories
- Consider the component api in advance
- Increase code reuse and shareability accross projects
- Allows multiple developers to work on single tasks. One can focus on getting data to the component and another can focus on what the component does with that data.

# Getting started
- Install yarn and react-native-cli globally
